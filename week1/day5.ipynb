      "🚀 Excited to announce we're releasing ScreenSuite - the most comprehensive evaluation suite for GUI Agents!\n",
      "\n",
      "GUI Agents have exploded since Claude Computer Use launched, but evaluating them has been a nightmare... until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes ScreenSuite special?\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Brings together 13 different benchmarks from state-of-the-art research\n",
      "✅ Vision-only evaluation (no cheating with DOM trees or APIs)\n",
      "✅ Ubuntu & Android environments Dockerized for strong reproducibility\n",
      "✅ Extensive test coverage across mobile, desktop, and web\n",

      "📱 Mobile Android task scenarios across diverse apps\n",
      "🖥️ Complex desktop task navigation\n",
      "🌐 Comprehensive web interaction scenarios\n",
      "🤖 Multi-step agentic capabilities across all platforms\n",
      "\n",
      "We tested leading VLMs including GPT-4o, QwenVL, UI-TARS, … . The results? Even top models struggle with multi-step GUI tasks - highlighting just how challenging this space is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this matters: GUI agents represent the future of human-computer interaction. They need to navigate interfaces just like we do and even better - through vision alone, not privileged access to code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ready to benchmark your GUI agent? ScreenSuite makes it simple.\n",
